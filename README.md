## Project Overview


The main objectives of the project were:

- Feature Analysis: The project started with a detailed analysis of the dataset features to identify key variables affecting employee attrition.
- Data Preprocessing: Categorical features were preprocessed using LabelEncoder to convert them into numerical values, suitable for machine learning models.
- Modeling: The project compared the performance of two classification models, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, to determine the most effective model for predicting employee attrition.





## Technologies Used

**Python**

**Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Outcome

The project provided valuable insights into predicting employee attrition in HR analytics using machine learning. The comparison of different models helped understand their effectiveness in this context.
